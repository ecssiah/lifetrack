# LifeTrack

This application tracks longterm progress towards life goals. The user gains experience based on the time they devote to each goal. Each time the user gains 100 experience in a goal, they reach a new level. At level 1200, the user will have put 10,000 hours into a goal.   

The application is based on the pomodoro technique, which involves short periods of focused work on a single task with regular breaks.
